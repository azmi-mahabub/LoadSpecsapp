## 4. ✅ Improved Burnout Score Calculation

**Issue:** Burnout score not properly considering deadlines, priority, and clustering

**Fix Applied - Smart Algorithm:**

### **Scoring Factors (0-100 scale):**

1. **Task Count (0-20 points)**
   - More active tasks = higher score
   - 3 points per task (capped at 20)

2. **High Priority Tasks (0-25 points)**
   - High priority tasks add stress
   - 8 points per high-priority task

3. **In-Progress Tasks (0-15 points)**
   - Tasks being worked on are more stressful
   - 5 points per in-progress task

4. **Deadline Proximity (0-30 points)**
   - Overdue: +10 points each
   - ≤2 days: +8 points (very urgent)
   - 3-5 days: +5 points (urgent)
   - 6-10 days: +2 points (somewhat urgent)
   - **20+ days: NO points** (low stress)

5. **Deadline Clustering (0-20 points)**
   - Tasks ≤3 days apart: +5 points (high stress)
   - Tasks ≥20 days apart: -2 points (reduced stress)

6. **Recent Mood (0-20 points)**
   - Burnout mood: +5 points each
   - Stressed mood: +3 points each

### **Score Interpretation:**
- **75-100**: High Risk ⚠️
- **50-74**: Medium Risk ⚡
- **25-49**: Low Risk 💛
- **0-24**: Healthy ✅

### **Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: High Burnout**
```
- 5 high-priority tasks (25 points)
- 3 in-progress (15 points)
- 2 tasks due tomorrow (16 points)
- 2 tasks due in 2 days (16 points)
- All deadlines within 3 days (10 points clustering)
- 2 burnout moods recently (10 points)
Total: 92 points = HIGH RISK ⚠️
```

**Scenario 2: Low Burnout**
```
- 2 medium-priority tasks (6 points)
- 1 in-progress (5 points)
- Due dates: 15 days and 25 days apart (5 points, -2 clustering)
- Happy moods (0 points)
Total: 14 points = HEALTHY ✅
```

**Changes:**
- `LoadSpecsApp/models.py` - Complete rewrite of `calculate_burnout_score()`
- Now considers ALL requested factors
